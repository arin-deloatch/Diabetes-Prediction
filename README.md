# Diabetes Prediction

### Built With Python 3.11

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### Project Description

The business needs are centered around enhancing the early detection and management of diabetes to improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resources. Our machine learning model offers a sophisticated approach to predicting diabetes onset by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of health metrics. This predictive capability empowers healthcare providers to identify at-risk individuals early and take proactive measures to mitigate the disease's impact.

<!-- Installation and Running the Project -->
### Installation and Running the Project
1. Clone the repo 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arin-deloatch/Group-5-Final-Project.git
    ```
   
2. Ensure the necessary packages are installed via your package manager (pip, anaconda,etc.) and import the modules into your python/notebook file. 
    ```
   pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
     ```
3. If you're using the ucimlrepo library for importing the data, be sure to install and import the dependencies.
  ```
  pip install ucimlrepo
  from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo
 ```

### Data
You can find the data file we used for our statistical analyses in the "data" folder as "diabetes.csv". The .csv file format was used because it was the most familiar for the team. Feel free to change parameters and slice up the data any way you'd like to interpret different types of results. It's important to note that the majority of features are categorical and if you'd like a feature breakdown you can visit the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators" target="_blank">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>
